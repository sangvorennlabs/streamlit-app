The U.S. government's cybersecurity agency CISA has also sounded the alarm in an advisory urging federal agencies to patch against the actively exploited flaw.\n\nHere's what we know so far.\n\nOn October 10,  network equipment maker Citrix disclosed the vulnerability affecting on-premise versions of its NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway platforms,  which large enterprises and governments use for application delivery and VPN connectivity.\n\nThe flaw is described as a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to extract large amounts of data from a vulnerable Citrix device's memory,  including sensitive session tokens (hence the name \"CitrixBleed.\") The bug requires little effort or complexity to exploit,  allowing hackers to hijack and use legitimate session tokens to compromise a victim's network without needing a password or using two-factor.\n\nCitrix released patches,  but a week later on October 17 updated its advisory to advise that it had observed exploitation in the wild.\n\nEarly victims included professional services,  technology,  and government organizations,  according to incident response giant Mandiant,  which said it began investigating after discovering \"multiple instances of successful exploitation\" as early as late-August before Citrix made patches available.\n\nRobert Knapp,  head of incident response at cybersecurity firm Rapid7 -- which also began investigating the bug after detecting potential exploitation of the bug in a customer's network -- said the company has also observed attackers targeting organizations across healthcare,  manufacturing,  and retail.\n\n\"Rapid7 incident responders have observed both lateral movement and data access in the course of our investigations, \" said Knapp,  suggesting hackers are able to gain broader access to victims' network and data after initial compromise.\n\nCybersecurity company ReliaQuest said last week it has evidence that at least four threat groups -- which it did not name -- are leveraging CitrixBleed,  with at least one group automating the attack process.\n\nOne of the threat actors is believed to be the Russia-linked LockBit ransomware gang,  which has already claimed responsibility for several large-scale breaches believed to be associated with CitrixBleed.\n\nSecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont wrote in a blog post Tuesday that the LockBit gang last week hacked into the U.S. branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) -- said to be the world's largest lender by assets -- by compromising an unpatched Citrix Netscaler box. The outage disrupted the banking giant's ability to clear trades. According to Bloomberg on Tuesday,  the firm has yet to restore normal operations.\n\nICBC,  which reportedly paid LockBit's ransom demand,  declined to answer TechCrunch's questions but said in a statement on its website that it \"experienced a ransomware attack\" that \"resulted in disruption to certain systems.\"\n\nA LockBit representative told Reuters on Monday that ICBC \"paid a ransom -- deal closed, \" but did not provide evidence of their claim. LockBit also told malware research group vx-underground that ICBC paid a ransom,  but declined to say how much.\n\nBeaumont said in a post on Mastodon that Boeing also had an unpatched Citrix Netscaler system at the time of its LockBit breach,  citing data from Shodan,  a search engine for exposed databases and devices.\n\nBoeing spokesperson Jim Proulx previously told TechCrunch that the company is \"aware of a cyber incident impacting elements of our parts and distribution business\" but would not comment on LockBit's alleged publication of stolen data.\n\nAllen & Overy,  one of the world's largest law firms,  was also running an affected Citrix system at the time of its compromise,  Beaumont noted. LockBit added both Boeing and Allen & Overy to its dark web leak site,  which ransomware gangs typically use to extort victims by publishing files unless the victims pay a ransom demand. A spokesperson for Allen & Overy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Medusa ransomware gang is also exploiting CitrixBleed to compromise targeted organizations,  said Beaumont.\n\n\"We would expect CVE-2023-4966 to be one of the top routinely exploited vulnerabilities from 2023, \" Rapid7's head of vulnerability research Caitlin Condon told TechCrunch.",

        "input": "Among other things,  bug allows code running inside a VM to crash hypervisors.\n\nOn Tuesday,  Intel pushed microcode updates to fix a high-severity CPU bug that has the potential to be maliciously exploited against cloud-based hosts.\n\nThe flaw,  affecting virtually all modern Intel CPUs,  causes them to \"enter a glitch state where the normal rules don't apply, \" Tavis Ormandy,  one of several security researchers inside Google who discovered the bug,  reported. Once triggered,  the glitch state results in unexpected and potentially serious behavior,  most notably system crashes that occur even when untrusted code is executed within a guest account of a virtual machine,  which,  under most cloud security models,  is assumed to be safe from such faults. Escalation of privileges is also a possibility.\n\nVery strange behavior\n\nThe bug,  tracked under the common name Reptar and the designation CVE-2023-23583,  is related to how affected CPUs manage prefixes,  which change the behavior of instructions sent by running software. Intel x64 decoding generally allows redundant prefixes -- meaning those that don't make sense in a given context -- to be ignored without consequence. During testing in August,  Ormandy noticed that the REX prefix was generating \"unexpected results\" when running on Intel CPUs that support a newer feature known as fast short repeat move,  which was introduced in the Ice Lake architecture to fix microcoding bottlenecks.\n\nThe unexpected behavior occurred when adding the redundant rex.r prefixes to the FSRM-optimized rep mov operation. Ormandy wrote: \n\nWe observed some very strange behavior while testing. For example,  branches to unexpected locations,  unconditional branches being ignored and the processor no longer accurately recording the instruction pointer in xsave or call instructions.\n\nOddly,  when trying to understand what was happening we would see a debugger reporting impossible states!\n\nThis already seemed like it could be indicative of a serious problem,  but within a few days of experimenting we found that when multiple cores were triggering the same bug,  the processor would begin to report machine check exceptions and halt.\n\nWe verified this worked even inside an unprivileged guest VM,  so this already has serious security implications for cloud providers. Naturally,  we reported this to Intel as soon as we confirmed this was a security issue.\n\nJerry Bryant,  Intel's senior director of Incident Response & Security Communications,  said on Tuesday that company engineers were already aware of a \"functional bug\" in older CPU platforms that could result in a temporary denial of service and had scheduled a fix for next March. The severity rating had tentatively been set at 5 out of a possible 10. Those plans were disrupted following discoveries within Intel and later inside Google. Bryant wrote: \n\nThanks to the diligence and expertise of Intel security researchers,  a vector was later discovered that could allow a possible escalation of privilege (EoP). With an updated CVSS 3.0 score of 8.8 (high),  this discovery changed our approach to mitigating this issue for our customers and we pulled the update forward to align with disclosures already planned for November 2023.\n\nWhile preparing the February 2024 Intel Platform Update bundle for customer validation,  we received a report from a Google researcher for the same TDoS issue discovered internally. The researcher cited a Google 90 day disclosure policy and that they would go public on November 14,  2023.\n\nCrisis (hopefully) averted\n\nGoogle worked with industry partners to identify and test a successful mitigation so all users are protected from this risk in a timely manner. In particular,  Google's response team ensured a successful rollout of the mitigation to our systems before it posed a risk to our customers,  mainly Google Cloud and ChromeOS customers.\n\nIntel's official bulletin lists two classes of affected products:  those that were already fixed and those that are fixed using microcode updates released Tuesday. Specifically,  these products have the new microcode update: \n\nProduct Collection Vertical Segment CPU ID Platform ID 10th Generation Intel Core Processor Family Mobile 706E5 80 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family Server 606A6 87 Intel Xeon D Processor Server 606C1 10 11th Generation Intel Core Processor Family Desktop\n\nEmbedded\n\nA0671 02 11th Generation Intel Core Processor Family Mobile\n\nEmbedded\n\n806C1\n\n806C2\n\n806D1\n\n80\n\nC2\n\nC2\n\nIntel Server Processor Server\n\nEmbedded\n\nA0671 02\n\nAn exhaustive list of affected CPUs is available here. As usual,  the microcode updates will be available from device or motherboard manufacturers. While individuals aren't likely to face any immediate threat from this vulnerability,  they should check with the manufacturer for a fix.\n\nPeople with expertise in x86 instruction and decoding should read Ormandy's post in its entirety. For everyone else,  the most important takeaway is this:  \"However,  we simply don't know if we can control the corruption precisely enough to achieve privilege escalation.\" That means it's not possible for people outside of Intel to know the true extent of the vulnerability severity. That said,  anytime code running inside a virtual machine can crash the hypervisor the VM runs on,  cloud providers like Google,  Microsoft,  Amazon,  and others are going to immediately take notice.\n\nIn a separate post,  Google officials wrote: \n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is demonstrated when exploited by an attacker in a multi-tenant virtualized environment,  as the exploit on a guest machine causes the host machine to crash resulting in a Denial of Service to other guest machines running on the same host. Additionally,  the vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation.\n\nThe post said that Google worked with industry partners to identify and test successful mitigations that have been rolled out. It's likely any potential crisis has now been averted,  at least in the biggest cloud environments. Smaller cloud services may still have work to do.",

The liabilities of UK telecoms company BT's fund are more than three times its \u00a312bn market value. But a costly and drawn-out renovation job has repaired the worst of the damage.\n\nThe BT fund's triennial valuation on Tuesday showed the scheme was on track to be fully funded by 2030. The deficit has more than halved to \u00a33.7bn in the three years to June 2023. This was down to contributions. Hedging limited the benefit from the interest rate rises. The fall in liabilities of just over a third in the three years to 2023 was matched by a similar decline in the valuation of assets.\n\nNeither this figure,  nor the company's pledge to go on pouring \u00a3600mn a year into the scheme,  surprised the market. That predictability means one less distraction for incoming chief executive Allison Kirkby. She is due to take over from Philip Jansen by the end of January.\n\nRisks remain. The pension fund has cut its equity holdings by three-quarters,  but holds \u00a311bn -- or 30 per cent of the total -- in other \"growth\" assets including private equity and property. Investors might fret about looming writedowns in private markets.\n\nMoreover,  other measures of the deficit are more alarming. Reducing the discount rate to just 50 basis points above the risk-free rate -- in line with the pension regulator's new guidelines for mature schemes -- would put the deficit at \u00a36bn,  according to pensions expert John Ralfe. An even bigger number -- just over \u00a39bn -- would apply if BT paid an insurer to take on liabilities.\n\nSuch factors should weigh heavily in the calculations of French telecoms tycoon Patrick Drahi who has built up an equity exposure of 24.5 per cent. An agreement not to bid for BT expires on November 24.\n\nJames Ratzer of New Street Research argues a leveraged buyout that more than doubled net debt-to-ebitda to 4.25 times could be perceived as a 55 per cent weakening of the covenant. The pension fund trustees might require a hefty top-up payment to compensate. The arcane world of pension valuations could be set to move into the spotlight.",

            "long": "- BT's pension fund deficit has significantly improved,  halving to \u00a33.7bn in the three years to June 2023. The company's triennial valuation showed that the scheme is on track to be fully funded by 2030. This improvement is attributed to contributions and hedging,  although the fall in liabilities was matched by a decline in asset valuation.\n- The predictability of these figures and BT's commitment to contribute \u00a3600mn annually to the scheme are seen as a positive for the incoming CEO,  Allison Kirkby. However,  risks remain,  particularly with the fund's asset allocation. The pension fund has reduced its equity holdings but still holds a significant amount in other \"growth\" assets,  including private equity and property.\n- The article highlights potential concerns about looming writedowns in private markets and the impact of other measures of the deficit. For instance,  reducing the discount rate or paying an insurer to take on liabilities could significantly increase the deficit.\n- The future actions of French telecoms tycoon Patrick Drahi,  who has built up an equity exposure of 24.5 per cent and has an agreement not to bid for BT expiring soon,  could also impact the pension fund. The article suggests that a leveraged buyout could weaken the covenant and potentially require a hefty top-up payment to the pension fund trustees."

        "input": "Click to save this article.You'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account.\n\nI'm the CEO and cofounder of RentSpree,  and I write about real estate business. RentSpree is reimagining how people rent homes.\n\nOften seen as the \"American dream, \" a detached home with a white picket fence is an image deeply ingrained in our national psyche. Yet,  this dream seems increasingly distant for many,  particularly the younger generation.\n\nToday,  renters are facing a number of challenges that real estate professionals should be paying attention to: \n\n1. Affordability woes:  For many Americans,  especially renters,  the distinctions between the rental and for-sale markets are stark,  as homeownership is often seen as an unattainable goal. Prices of houses have skyrocketed in recent years,  reaching a near-record median price of $410, 200 in June. In states like California and Washington,  the story gets grimmer. Compounding this is the near-8% mortgage rate.\n\nSuch dynamics in the for-sale market have an inevitable ripple effect on the rental landscape. As homeownership becomes challenging,  many people,  particularly Millennials,  seek rentals. This trend has pushed up the average age of first-time homeowners to 36 and drives about 36% of U.S. households into rentals.\n\n2. Rental shortages and implications:  The rental market is directly related to the for-sale segment. A surge in demand has stressed the rental sector. The repercussions are apparent:  an alarming shortage of 3.8 million units of housing and spiraling rents. Prices are surging in response,  with the U.S. average rent coming in at $2, 011 and average monthly rates in places like New York touching $4, 450.\n\n3. Rent control:  In attempts to curtail these skyrocketing rents and offer some reprieve,  the discourse on rent control has returned to the fore. With roots in the 1920s and now under renewed focus from the Biden administration,  I'm seeing rent control measures proliferating in several states. While these measures can be beneficial,  particularly to long-term residents,  the broader implications of rent control are complex. From my view,  constrained by controlled rates,  some property owners might seek alternative,  more lucrative avenues,  which could result in a decreased rental supply.\n\nThere are a few considerations real estate professionals can keep in mind moving forward to navigate and address these challenges.\n\nFacilitating new builds can provide a much-needed equilibrium to the market. States like California are trying to embrace this approach by extending a law that makes it easier to initiate large-scale affordable housing projects,  thereby protecting them from bureaucratic red tape and potential legal hurdles. Some effects are already palpable,  as the law has already led to the construction of thousands of new units in the state,  the Los Angeles Times reported. To me,  this signals hope and opens a more comprehensive range of choices for renters.\n\nReal estate leaders can help support the housing construction process by advocating for similar policies and studying builders in California to see if any of those strategies can be used in their own areas or communities.\n\nIf you're an investor hoping to buy and/or invest in a property,  adapting financial plans accordingly is a wise approach for the future. While hoping for lower interest rates is natural,  preparing for the possibility that they may remain stable or even rise is essential. Ultimately,  embracing the uncertainty of interest rates and aligning a financial strategy is responsible and pragmatic.\n\nReal estate professionals' value transcends beyond the traditional domain of facilitating transactions. Today,  real estate leaders are educators guiding clients through this ever-evolving maze. They can demystify market intricacies,  offer invaluable insights and,  in essence,  act as trusted advocates.\n\nYou can fill this important role by translating complex real estate jargon into simple language when speaking with buyers or renters. You can also illuminate market trends today and in the coming months,  help with mortgage rate and downpayment estimates,  point to tools to help build a solid credit history and help research the pros and cons of different markets locally and across the country.\n\nReal estate professionals have always been the linchpin in the complex transactional process of purchasing a property. As the U.S. real estate landscape continually reshapes,  one element remains steadfast:  the indispensable role of education and knowledge.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

Tim Salm with Jameson Sotheby's International Realty is listing the property and did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe home was initially listed for sale at $50 million,  and subsequent price cuts brought the listing down to $45 million and then $30 million. In September,  the ask was chopped again to $27 million before this month's trim.\n\nThe $23.5 million asking price pulls the home more closely into the orbit of Chicago's most expensive residential real estate deals in the last several years,  making a potential sale more likely. It would also mark a loss of $41.5 million from what the owners said they initially paid to acquire the lots and build the home.\n\nThis year,  with climbing interest rates and an overall slowing luxury market,  major sales have been much less frequent than prior years.\n\nIn 2022,  Chicago had two $20 million residential sales. Those properties were the sale of the penthouse at Trump Tower for $20 million and the sale of the penthouse at the St. Regis for $20.6 million. So far this year,  though,  the biggest sale of the year so far in Chicagoland has been for a $12.5 million mansion in Winnetka.\n\nThe Burling Street home's time on the market shows the upper limits of Chicago's residential real estate market,  where top-of-the-line homes sell for considerably less than their equivalents in New York,  Los Angeles or Miami.\n\nThe Parrillos bought the eight city lots on Burling Street in 2016. Richard,  founder and CEO of Florida-based United Auto Insurance,  said the project wasn't supposed to be so grand,  but it was a \"labor of love\" for his wife,  so its cost increased over time.\n\nThe six-bedroom home also has a speakeasy bar area and a 5, 000-bottle wine cellar and tasting room modeled after a building at Versailles.\n\nDespite the price cut,  the home is still the highest priced listing on the market,  with few other listings coming close. Those include a $22 million suburban estate listing in Lake Bluff that was designed by David Adler and a $15.7 million home in the Gold Coast.",
