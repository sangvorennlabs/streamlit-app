The U.S. government's cybersecurity agency CISA has also sounded the alarm in an advisory urging federal agencies to patch against the actively exploited flaw.\n\nHere's what we know so far.\n\nOn October 10,  network equipment maker Citrix disclosed the vulnerability affecting on-premise versions of its NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway platforms,  which large enterprises and governments use for application delivery and VPN connectivity.\n\nThe flaw is described as a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to extract large amounts of data from a vulnerable Citrix device's memory,  including sensitive session tokens (hence the name \"CitrixBleed.\") The bug requires little effort or complexity to exploit,  allowing hackers to hijack and use legitimate session tokens to compromise a victim's network without needing a password or using two-factor.\n\nCitrix released patches,  but a week later on October 17 updated its advisory to advise that it had observed exploitation in the wild.\n\nEarly victims included professional services,  technology,  and government organizations,  according to incident response giant Mandiant,  which said it began investigating after discovering \"multiple instances of successful exploitation\" as early as late-August before Citrix made patches available.\n\nRobert Knapp,  head of incident response at cybersecurity firm Rapid7 -- which also began investigating the bug after detecting potential exploitation of the bug in a customer's network -- said the company has also observed attackers targeting organizations across healthcare,  manufacturing,  and retail.\n\n\"Rapid7 incident responders have observed both lateral movement and data access in the course of our investigations, \" said Knapp,  suggesting hackers are able to gain broader access to victims' network and data after initial compromise.\n\nCybersecurity company ReliaQuest said last week it has evidence that at least four threat groups -- which it did not name -- are leveraging CitrixBleed,  with at least one group automating the attack process.\n\nOne of the threat actors is believed to be the Russia-linked LockBit ransomware gang,  which has already claimed responsibility for several large-scale breaches believed to be associated with CitrixBleed.\n\nSecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont wrote in a blog post Tuesday that the LockBit gang last week hacked into the U.S. branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) -- said to be the world's largest lender by assets -- by compromising an unpatched Citrix Netscaler box. The outage disrupted the banking giant's ability to clear trades. According to Bloomberg on Tuesday,  the firm has yet to restore normal operations.\n\nICBC,  which reportedly paid LockBit's ransom demand,  declined to answer TechCrunch's questions but said in a statement on its website that it \"experienced a ransomware attack\" that \"resulted in disruption to certain systems.\"\n\nA LockBit representative told Reuters on Monday that ICBC \"paid a ransom -- deal closed, \" but did not provide evidence of their claim. LockBit also told malware research group vx-underground that ICBC paid a ransom,  but declined to say how much.\n\nBeaumont said in a post on Mastodon that Boeing also had an unpatched Citrix Netscaler system at the time of its LockBit breach,  citing data from Shodan,  a search engine for exposed databases and devices.\n\nBoeing spokesperson Jim Proulx previously told TechCrunch that the company is \"aware of a cyber incident impacting elements of our parts and distribution business\" but would not comment on LockBit's alleged publication of stolen data.\n\nAllen & Overy,  one of the world's largest law firms,  was also running an affected Citrix system at the time of its compromise,  Beaumont noted. LockBit added both Boeing and Allen & Overy to its dark web leak site,  which ransomware gangs typically use to extort victims by publishing files unless the victims pay a ransom demand. A spokesperson for Allen & Overy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Medusa ransomware gang is also exploiting CitrixBleed to compromise targeted organizations,  said Beaumont.\n\n\"We would expect CVE-2023-4966 to be one of the top routinely exploited vulnerabilities from 2023, \" Rapid7's head of vulnerability research Caitlin Condon told TechCrunch.", "old_summary": {"short": "Citrix customers are urged to patch their systems as a ransomware gang exploits a critical vulnerability,  affecting big-name firms worldwide.", "long": "- Security researchers have discovered that a critical vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler systems is being exploited by a ransomware gang to launch cyberattacks against major organizations globally.

Once triggered,  the glitch state results in unexpected and potentially serious behavior,  most notably system crashes that occur even when untrusted code is executed within a guest account of a virtual machine,  which,  under most cloud security models,  is assumed to be safe from such faults. Escalation of privileges is also a possibility.\n\nVery strange behavior\n\nThe bug,  tracked under the common name Reptar and the designation CVE-2023-23583,  is related to how affected CPUs manage prefixes,  which change the behavior of instructions sent by running software. Intel x64 decoding generally allows redundant prefixes -- meaning those that don't make sense in a given context -- to be ignored without consequence. During testing in August,  Ormandy noticed that the REX prefix was generating \"unexpected results\" when running on Intel CPUs that support a newer feature known as fast short repeat move,  which was introduced in the Ice Lake architecture to fix microcoding bottlenecks.\n\nThe unexpected behavior occurred when adding the redundant rex.r prefixes to the FSRM-optimized rep mov operation. Ormandy wrote: \n\nWe observed some very strange behavior while testing. For example,  branches to unexpected locations,  unconditional branches being ignored and the processor no longer accurately recording the instruction pointer in xsave or call instructions.\n\nOddly,  when trying to understand what was happening we would see a debugger reporting impossible states!\n\nThis already seemed like it could be indicative of a serious problem,  but within a few days of experimenting we found that when multiple cores were triggering the same bug,  the processor would begin to report machine check exceptions and halt.\n\nWe verified this worked even inside an unprivileged guest VM,  so this already has serious security implications for cloud providers. Naturally,  we reported this to Intel as soon as we confirmed this was a security issue.\n\nJerry Bryant,  Intel's senior director of Incident Response & Security Communications,  said on Tuesday that company engineers were already aware of a \"functional bug\" in older CPU platforms that could result in a temporary denial of service and had scheduled a fix for next March. The severity rating had tentatively been set at 5 out of a possible 10. Those plans were disrupted following discoveries within Intel and later inside Google. Bryant wrote: \n\nThanks to the diligence and expertise of Intel security researchers,  a vector was later discovered that could allow a possible escalation of privilege (EoP). With an updated CVSS 3.0 score of 8.8 (high),  this discovery changed our approach to mitigating this issue for our customers and we pulled the update forward to align with disclosures already planned for November 2023.\n\nWhile preparing the February 2024 Intel Platform Update bundle for customer validation,  we received a report from a Google researcher for the same TDoS issue discovered internally. The researcher cited a Google 90 day disclosure policy and that they would go public on November 14,  2023.\n\nCrisis (hopefully) averted\n\nGoogle worked with industry partners to identify and test a successful mitigation so all users are protected from this risk in a timely manner. In particular,  Google's response team ensured a successful rollout of the mitigation to our systems before it posed a risk to our customers,  mainly Google Cloud and ChromeOS customers.\n\nIntel's official bulletin lists two classes of affected products:  those that were already fixed and those that are fixed using microcode updates released Tuesday. Specifically,  these products have the new microcode update: \n\nProduct Collection Vertical Segment CPU ID Platform ID 10th Generation Intel Core Processor Family Mobile 706E5 80 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family Server 606A6 87 Intel Xeon D Processor Server 606C1 10 11th Generation Intel Core Processor Family Desktop\n\nEmbedded\n\nA0671 02 11th Generation Intel Core Processor Family Mobile\n\nEmbedded\n\n806C1\n\n806C2\n\n806D1\n\n80\n\nC2\n\nC2\n\nIntel Server Processor Server\n\nEmbedded\n\nA0671 02\n\nAn exhaustive list of affected CPUs is available here. As usual,  the microcode updates will be available from device or motherboard manufacturers. While individuals aren't likely to face any immediate threat from this vulnerability,  they should check with the manufacturer for a fix.\n\nPeople with expertise in x86 instruction and decoding should read Ormandy's post in its entirety. For everyone else,  the most important takeaway is this:  \"However,  we simply don't know if we can control the corruption precisely enough to achieve privilege escalation.\" That means it's not possible for people outside of Intel to know the true extent of the vulnerability severity. That said,  anytime code running inside a virtual machine can crash the hypervisor the VM runs on,  cloud providers like Google,  Microsoft,  Amazon,  and others are going to immediately take notice.\n\nIn a separate post,  Google officials wrote: \n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is demonstrated when exploited by an attacker in a multi-tenant virtualized environment,  as the exploit on a guest machine causes the host machine to crash resulting in a Denial of Service to other guest machines running on the same host. Additionally,  the vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation.\n\nThe post said that Google worked with industry partners to identify and test successful mitigations that have been rolled out.

RentSpree is reimagining how people rent homes.\n\nOften seen as the \"American dream, \" a detached home with a white picket fence is an image deeply ingrained in our national psyche. Yet,  this dream seems increasingly distant for many,  particularly the younger generation.\n\nToday,  renters are facing a number of challenges that real estate professionals should be paying attention to: \n\n1. Affordability woes:  For many Americans,  especially renters,  the distinctions between the rental and for-sale markets are stark,  as homeownership is often seen as an unattainable goal. Prices of houses have skyrocketed in recent years,  reaching a near-record median price of $410, 200 in June. In states like California and Washington,  the story gets grimmer. Compounding this is the near-8% mortgage rate.\n\nSuch dynamics in the for-sale market have an inevitable ripple effect on the rental landscape. As homeownership becomes challenging,  many people,  particularly Millennials,  seek rentals. This trend has pushed up the average age of first-time homeowners to 36 and drives about 36% of U.S. households into rentals.\n\n2. Rental shortages and implications:  The rental market is directly related to the for-sale segment. A surge in demand has stressed the rental sector. The repercussions are apparent:  an alarming shortage of 3.8 million units of housing and spiraling rents. Prices are surging in response,  with the U.S. average rent coming in at $2, 011 and average monthly rates in places like New York touching $4, 450.\n\n3. Rent control:  In attempts to curtail these skyrocketing rents and offer some reprieve,  the discourse on rent control has returned to the fore. With roots in the 1920s and now under renewed focus from the Biden administration,  I'm seeing rent control measures proliferating in several states. While these measures can be beneficial,  particularly to long-term residents,  the broader implications of rent control are complex. From my view,  constrained by controlled rates,  some property owners might seek alternative,  more lucrative avenues,  which could result in a decreased rental supply.\n\nThere are a few considerations real estate professionals can keep in mind moving forward to navigate and address these challenges.\n\nFacilitating new builds can provide a much-needed equilibrium to the market. States like California are trying to embrace this approach by extending a law that makes it easier to initiate large-scale affordable housing projects,  thereby protecting them from bureaucratic red tape and potential legal hurdles. Some effects are already palpable,  as the law has already led to the construction of thousands of new units in the state,  the Los Angeles Times reported. To me,  this signals hope and opens a more comprehensive range of choices for renters.\n\nReal estate leaders can help support the housing construction process by advocating for similar policies and studying builders in California to see if any of those strategies can be used in their own areas or communities.\n\nIf you're an investor hoping to buy and/or invest in a property,  adapting financial plans accordingly is a wise approach for the future. While hoping for lower interest rates is natural,  preparing for the possibility that they may remain stable or even rise is essential. Ultimately,  embracing the uncertainty of interest rates and aligning a financial strategy is responsible and pragmatic.\n\nReal estate professionals' value transcends beyond the traditional domain of facilitating transactions. Today,  real estate leaders are educators guiding clients through this ever-evolving maze. They can demystify market intricacies,  offer invaluable insights and,  in essence,  act as trusted advocates.\n\nYou can fill this important role by translating complex real estate jargon into simple language when speaking with buyers or renters. You can also illuminate market trends today and in the coming months,  help with mortgage rate and downpayment estimates,  point to tools to help build a solid credit history and help research the pros and cons of different markets locally and across the country.\n\nReal estate professionals have always been the linchpin in the complex transactional process of purchasing a property.

ClAVIS offers Fintech solutions for emerging realities and ambitions.\n\nFueled by rising demand for accessibility of banking services in unconventional settings and technological breakthroughs,  neobanks have emerged as game-changers.\n\nNeobanks are evolving at a breakneck speed to level the financial field for the underbanked,  with the global neobank market expected to surge from approximately $72 billion in 2022 to over $2.15 trillion by 2030.\n\nIn its infancy,  \"underbanked\" was a label for people excluded from formal banking,  often due to limited access,  exorbitant fees or illiteracy.\n\nOver time,  it's morphed into a nuanced term,  encompassing those with documentation hurdles,  geographical disadvantages,  the uninterested and even individuals grappling with banking challenges like international payments.\n\nLet's examine how neobanks promise accessible,  hassle-free solutions primed to democratize financial services for the underbanked.\n\nNeobanks are independently functioning digital banks distinct from traditional banks in several ways. Here are a few key differences: \n\n* Operational Models:  Traditional banks are burdened by the overhead costs of physical branches,  including rent,  staff and maintenance. Neobanks,  operating exclusively online,  significantly reduce these expenses and allocate resources toward customer-centric services,  leading to a cost reduction of 60%-70%.\n\n* Flexibility And Adaptability:  Neobanks,  thanks to their digital infrastructure and collaborations with other fintechs,  quickly adapt to market trends and expand into new customer segments. Traditional banks,  constrained by legacy systems,  struggle to achieve such flexibility.\n\n* Customer Onboarding And Engagement:  Traditional banks often require a more extensive onboarding process involving paperwork,  in-person verification or meetings with bank representatives. Neobanks,  leveraging their digital platforms,  offer instant account setups -- often within minutes -- with seamless KYC (know-your-customer) processes.\n\nTheir engagement tools,  like instant notifications,  budgeting tools and financial insights,  provide customers with a more interactive banking experience.\n\n* Data Utilization And Personalization:  Neobanks often utilize cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning to analyze customer data and offer tailored financial products,  insights and advice. This allows them to serve each customer's unique needs better.\n\nTraditional banks,  while increasingly integrating these technologies for use cases like fraud detection and customer service,  may not utilize them as extensively for personalization due to their larger size and diverse client base.\n\nThe World Bank's recent report reveals that about 1.4 billion people lack bank accounts due to reasons like insufficient funds,  distance from financial institutions and lacking documentation. Neobanks offer tailored solutions for these underserved individuals.\n\n* Rural Access:  For those living in remote or rural areas,  traditional banking often entails long and inconvenient journeys to city-based branches. Neobanks,  with their digital-first approach,  bring banking right to their fingertips,  eradicating the need for physical visits and the challenges of paperwork.\n\n* Affordability For Low-Income Individuals:  Many working in urban environments face a constant battle against hidden fees from traditional banking systems. In contrast,  neobanks provide no-frills accounts,  minimal fees and offer microloan opportunities specifically designed for their financial realities.\n\n* Building Trust:  With a history riddled with stories of hidden charges and convoluted terms,  many remain hesitant about banking. Neobanks counter this narrative by emphasizing transparent fee structures,  user-centric interfaces and responsive customer support,  cultivating trust and reliability.\n\n* International Transaction Ease:  Those engaged in international business or travel often grapple with the hassles of currency conversion and international transaction fees. Neobanks,  with their global focus,  streamline these processes,  with many offering seamless multi-currency transactions and reducing associated costs.\n\n* Tapping Into Emerging Markets:  In rapidly digitizing economies,  many find themselves at the crossroads of progress and traditional banking barriers. Neobanks bridge this gap by introducing digitized,  locally relevant services that cater directly to these needs.\n\nIn the neobanking sector,  it's anticipated that by 2027,  there will be around 376.90 million users worldwide. Despite the potential that neobanks offer,  they need to overcome many challenges to be successful.\n\nThere are over 10, 000 commercial banks worldwide,  in contrast to a mere 276 neobanks (at the time of writing). With collaborative support from governments,  tech companies and venture capitalists,  these numbers are set to rise.\n\n* Regulatory Hurdles:  Obtaining a \"digital banking license\" is a convoluted journey for neobanks. Over the years,  alternative fintech licensing in the forms of Money Service Business,  E-Money Licenses and Open Banking Collaboration,  etc.,  have helped fintechs come under financial regulatory coverage.

The success stories from the Asia Pacific to Latin America and Africa highlight the transformative potential neobanks hold in democratizing finance.\n\n* Profit:  Beyond their noble goal of financial inclusivity,  neobanks also present a lucrative opportunity. Their operational models -- freed from traditional banking overheads -- coupled with their appeal to a broad audience,  promise significant profitability,  attracting investors' eyes and dollars.\n\n* Partnership:  The essence of neobanks' growth strategy lies in forging strong partnerships.

Like the sepia-tinted images of tail-coated bankers in grand banking halls,  private banking has gone the way of many traditional activities.\n\nSynonymous with exclusivity,  clients relied on the expertise of their personal bankers to manage their wealth,  provide investment advice and products and navigate complex financial landscapes. The emphasis was on relationships,  trust and one-on-one consultations. Private banks offered a truly personalized experience where the management of money in large or small quantities was never a problem.\n\nGone are those days.\n\nThis is 2023,  and we are in the midst of a technological and regulatory revolution. Not only does technology now provide for faster transactional banking services,  but more importantly,  the risk landscape has changed for clients and banks alike. Regulators on a worldwide basis are now demanding that operational risk is removed within banking but also that every out-of-the-ordinary transaction is investigated and accounted for (and probably reported to some authority).\n\nAnd the real cost of delivering a truly personalized service makes it complicated to operate successfully. This is perhaps one reason why I've seen a growing general malaise among clients and bankers. The coffin nails were forged when cost efficiencies were prioritized over service,  according to one disgruntled London-based private banker I was speaking to. It was naive to think that an invitation to a Wimbledon or Glyndebourne event,  he said,  would paper over the cracks of a service that could no longer offer bespoke solutions for clients.\n\nAnd it's not just a U.K. problem. A Monaco banker complained that their job \"had become thankless.\" Where it was once about excellent client relationships,  they were now left hamstrung by the regulators and shouted at by the clients.\n\nAnd so wealth management has moved into focus -- with agile,  client-centered boutiques able to offer a truly personalized service at an attractive price.\n\nMeanwhile,  technology enters stage left,  disrupting this market and the decades of carefully curated banking relationships. Fintech companies are innovating faster than ever. They are capable of providing what a private bank does,  but with a key difference:  accessibility. A regulated fintech with a software-as-a-financial-service platform can provide transaction banking services to wealthy audiences via commercial partners,  such as brokers and agents,  that have a preexisting client relationship.\n\nAnd it's moving fast. \"Technological change is exponential. ... We won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century - it will be more like 20, 000 years of progress, \" wrote Ray Kurzweil,  the American computer scientist,  author,  inventor and futurist.\n\nAnd it's not just tech for tech's sake; lower fees charged by fintechs in both transaction banking and wealth management compared to private banks open them up to a much wider audience and,  dare I say it,  democratize private banking services. Add to that data analytics and algorithms power tailored financial advice,  budgeting and financial planning tools and investment management,  all in real time,  and we have an evolved,  sophisticated system that is inclusive and helps bridge the wealth gap. Importantly,  it captures the imagination of the next generation of high net worth and ultrahigh net worth individuals.\n\nI believe the era of personalized service in banking as we knew it is now well and truly gone. The cost and regulatory burden now outweigh the advantage of offering a service where experienced individuals are given the flexibility to make judgments and decisions. You need to have versatile methods for running your estate.\n\nToday's financial services landscape is about the way things are paid for. It is about automating payments. Technology streamlines financial tasks,  automates processes such as investment portfolio rebalancing and expense management while saving time and reducing the risk of human error. The latter is particularly pertinent in the face of recent relentless cyber breaches and attacks.\n\nAs we move toward the future at lightning speed,  it is crucial to be anchored by the cornerstone of every successful business -- the customers. This means ensuring that customers are always able to resolve any problems they may encounter,  or seek advice when they need it,  in a frictionless and easy manner. And for that,  there is nothing better than human interaction in my opinion. Technology mustn't be used at the cost of human connection.\n\nTechnology must be leveraged for operational efficiency,  addressing regulatory challenges and not least to remain vigilant in the face of cybersecurity concerns. Human expertise and intuition can benefit manifold with the efficiency of automation. The demise of private banking is,  therefore,  not the end,  but rather an opportunity for reinvention and adaptation in the fast-paced world of finance.\n\nForbes Coaches Council is an invitation-only community for leading business and career coaches.
